This is one of the project I am creating written in python. 
It follows the concept of an ATM machine. 
Where register users/account owners can view their account statement, 
withdraw money, deposit money as well as change their pin. 

The system is built to verify the user before undergoing any transaction. 
It automatically also updates the account with the new amount if any withdrawal or deposits were made. 

The user can also change his/her pin code as well.

Summary of the features.
1. User can sign in
2. User can view account statement
3. User can withdraw amount
3. User can deposit amount
5. User can change his/her pin
